<p>With this first project, I put on practice the following contents I
learned in the previous lessons:</p>
    <p>- The HTML boiler plate</p>
    <p>- The header and paragraph elements</p>
    <p>- The unordered list, ordered list and list item elements.</p>
    <p>- The anchor and image elements with its attributes.</p>

<p>I also make use of Git commands and GitHub, getting familiar with the
Git workflow.</p>

<p>I put me in the practice of good commit messages.</p>

<p>And finally, I put on practice good organization of the files and folders
in my project.</p>

<p>I'm eager to learn more and improve!</p>

<p>PS: sorry for mediocre English</p>
