With this first project, I put on practice the following contents I
learned in the previous lessons:
    - The HTML boiler plate
    - The <h1>, <h2> and <p> elements
    - The <ul>, <ol> and <li> elements
    - The <a> and <img> elements with its attributes

I also make use of Git commands and GitHub, getting familiar with the
Git workflow.

I put me in the practice of good commit messages.

And finally, I put on practice good organization of the files and folders
in my project.

I'm eager to learn more and improve!
